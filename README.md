# BLINK Detection algorithm

## Overview
------------
This project involves detecting eye blinks in EEG signals using a fully automated unsupervised algorithm. The dataset for this project was collected from open sources. The data has been filtered using various filters, and plots of the unfiltered signal, filtered signal, and a comparison of both are provided.

## Filtering and Visualization
------------------------------
The data has been processed through filters to remove noise and artifacts. The following plots are included in the project:
- Unfiltered EEG Signal
- Filtered EEG Signal
- Comparison of Unfiltered and Filtered Signals

## Usage
--------
To replicate the results presented in this project, follow these steps:
1. Place the collected EEG dataset in the `data/` folder.
2. Run the provided code to process the data and visualize the results.
